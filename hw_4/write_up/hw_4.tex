\section*{Problem 1:}
\subsection*{a}
There is a loop dependence because each iteration is dependent
on the previous interation.  This occurs in the following line
of code:\\
\[
a[i]=a[i-1]+i
\]
\subsection*{b}
It is very difficult to remove this loop dependence; however,
since the first line in the loop is only taking the sum of
the first $i$ numbers, the loop can be rewritten as follows:\\
\begin{lstlisting}
a[0] = 0;
b[0] = 0;
for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    a[i] = i*(i+1)/2;
    b[i] = a[i];
}
\end{lstlisting}
This loop is parallelizable since the dependence has been removed.
